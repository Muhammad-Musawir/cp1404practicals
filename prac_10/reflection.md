# Reflection on Practical Tasks in CP1404

## Estimates Accuracy

During the practical tasks in CP1404, my initial estimates were often optimistic. As I progressed through the subject, I noticed an improvement in estimating task completion times. This improvement came from gaining a better understanding of the complexity of coding tasks and the time required for debugging and testing.

## Code Reviews

### Being Reviewed
Participating in code reviews has been an invaluable learning experience. Feedback from peers highlighted areas where my code could be more readable and efficient. This feedback significantly improved my coding style and adherence to best practices.

### Doing Reviews
Conducting code reviews has enhanced my ability to identify potential issues in code written by others. Providing constructive feedback has not only helped my peers but has also reinforced concepts for me. It's a collaborative process that has fostered a sense of community and continuous improvement.

## Practical Tasks Overall

Reflecting on the practical tasks, one improvement could be more explicit guidance on certain topics. For instance, clearer instructions on handling specific edge cases or more comprehensive examples for complex concepts would enhance the learning experience. Additionally, a more structured feedback mechanism, perhaps involving one-on-one sessions, could provide personalized guidance to students with varying skill levels.
